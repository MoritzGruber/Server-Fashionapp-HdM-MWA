Backend / Server

We are using Docker Containers
##Running
Run the server with:
```
run ./start.sh
```
It just builds and runs our docker-compose.yml file, so look there for more details 
##Testing

For testing we use ava.js

Run the tests with:
```
run ./test.sh
```
Server should be already running when you start testing
